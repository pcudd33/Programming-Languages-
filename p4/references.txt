1) snail documentation & specification: https://snail-language.github.io/docs/specification#expression-values
  We used this reference to create all of the rules from the snail syntax into the correct SL-AST output format. 
  We took each informal spec from reference and used that to create the paser grammar rules which allowed us to acheice
  the proper SL-AST snail output. 


2) PLY: http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html
We used this reference to create the grammars from which we specified the format of each parser object within the snail syntax.
While comparing this source to the informal specification from the snail SL-AST we were able to create the grammar / evaluation rules 
for each accatable syntax pattern.


3) https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-remove-newline-from-string/
we used the reference in order to change the output that was created by the .strip() function to match the spec which used the .replace("\n", "") 
in order to make this correct with actual snail output.
