We used this website mostly for looking at psudo code for the recursive implementation of DFS through the use
of lists and ArrayLists with several recursive calls. This source also allowed us to implementation of the Visit funciton in a recursive manner 
and also allowed us to implement the temporary mark in order for checking for cycles.
