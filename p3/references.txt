1) https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html 

I used this source to determine what regular expression is to use for our Identifiers due to them needing to be 
able to handle all the specialty characters and special variations of characters. The XID_Start allows for all 
lower case and uppercase characters to be accepted as the first character. The XID_Continue allows for all special 
characters and special variations of characters along with all normal characters to be anywhere else within the rest 
of the Identifiers name.

2) https://snail-language.github.io/docs/specification

I used this source to allow myself to create all the proper syntactical structures to allow our 
lexer to include comments, all our operators, macros/constants, Whitespace, Identifiers, Integer Literals, and 
String Literals.

3) https://jflex.de/manual.html

I used this source for looking at how to set up my Lexer.flex class and how to implement specific aspects of the 
lexer itself.
